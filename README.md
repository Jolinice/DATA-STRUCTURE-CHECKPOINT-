**PROBLEM 1**
Distinct Elements Sum Algorithm:
This JavaScript algorithm is designed to find the sum of all distinct elements from two sets of elements.
It calculates the sum of elements that are present in either of the given sets.
The algorithm utilizes arrays for representing the sets and follows a straightforward approach to achieve the desired result.

**Problem Description:**
Given two sets of elements, the algorithm determines the sum of distinct elements. 
The sets are represented as arrays, and the goal is to find the sum of elements that are unique to either set.

**Example:**
Consider the following example:

Set 1: [3, 1, 7, 9]
Set 2: [2, 4, 1, 9, 3]

The algorithm outputs the sum of distinct elements: 13
Distinct elements: 4, 7, 2

**Solution:**
The algorithm initializes the sum to 0 and compares each element of one set with the other set.
If an element is not present, it is added to the sum. This process is then repeated in the reverse order for the second set. 
The final result is the sum of all distinct elements.

**Instructions:**
Clone the Repository:

Execute the algorithm and observe the output in the console.
Algorithm Implementation
The main algorithm is implemented in the findDistinctSum function in the distinctElementsSum.js file. 
Feel free to explore the code, comments, and modify the sets for your specific use case.



**FOR PROBLEM 2**

Algorithm: Check Orthogonality

**Description:**
Write an algorithm that determines, for n pairs of given vectors, whether two vectors of real numbers are orthogonal. 
This is done by calling the dot_product function defined in the previous question. The dot product of two orthogonal vectors is zero.

**Instructions:**
While using these algorithms, make sure to:

Use arrays for representing vectors.
Utilize nested loops (a loop inside another if needed).
Implement different types of parameter passing.
Feel free to modify the code and instructions based on your specific requirements.
